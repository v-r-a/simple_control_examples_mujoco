Three simple control examples.

Example: 
cd into bin, then
./inverted_pendulum ../model/inverted_pendulum/inverted_pendulum.xml 

See mycontroller() function to tweak the controller. Double inverted pendulum (acrobot) control based on the following work:
"Angular Momentum Based Controller for Balancing an Inverted Double Pendulum" by Morteza Azad and Roy Featherstone.

Disturb the models by double-clicking the desired body and then Ctrl + left click (position disturb) or right click (force disturb) to drag the body.
